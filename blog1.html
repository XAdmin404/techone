            <p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: Arapey, serif;"><br><br>My passion for computers dates back to my childhood. Ever since I was little, I used to button the computer, explore everything in it, walk through folders and create folders, etc. At the age of 8 I had my first tablet, which obviously
                I started to button. At first I played games, but over time I learned how things are and I started walking through it, having a burning desire to uninstall its system applications, eventually succeeding. The tablet and computer were my
                best friends for years to come. Two years later, I also had my first phone, where I used to play minecraft, I played with hacks, I always cheated. In I had become advanced in terms of operating systems. I was obsessed with minecraft. In
                2016, having a weak computer, I wanted to play minecraft, so I tried to make my cardboard computer work. I had started to install virtual machines, at that time I had learned to use CMD etc.<br><br></p><strong style="font-size: 30px;font-family: Arapey, serif;"><br>Programming itself<br><br></strong>
            <p
                style="font-size: 25px;font-family: Arapey, serif;"><br>In 2019, I found an ad on youtube, which introduced you to a free programming course. I started it, but I didn't really understand anything. It was a c ++ course, and just because I didn't understand anything, I dropped it. In 2020, at
                the beginning of the year, I resumed that course, where I laid the foundations of c ++. I learned about variables, operators, if and else, while for etc. After three months, I was able to write simple programs in c ++, and in the summer
                of 2020 I continued with algorithms. Also in the summer, I made my first website, but I did it a little because I did it after a tutorial on youtube, so it wasn't really done by me. I continued with algorithms and c ++ until the winter,
                when I started the curriculum after freecodecamp of responsive web design, which I recommend to everyone, where I continued until March this year when I took that certification, and I learned to create anything myself Web page. Now continue
                with JavaScript because I want to advance and create complex web applications.<br><br></p>
